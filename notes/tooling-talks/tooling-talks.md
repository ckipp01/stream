# Tooling talks

This has been something on my mind for quite a while now. I first played around
with this idea as a possible podcast, but recently as I've spent more time on
Twitch I think this would be a really cool idea to just stream. Over the past
year/ish the whole idea of how content is pushed out has changed due to the lack
of in-person conferences. While there are some digital conferences that are
filling the void, this doesn't replace the informal talks that I enjoyed having
with people when gathered, especially regarding topics that I'm specifically
interested in. For me, that's tooling. You'll notice that often at conferences
there will only be a single talk or maybe two on tooling, and that's sort of it.
I'd like to somehow open up the conversation on tooling, especially seeing that
it's something we as developers use daily.

## The format

My plan is to reach out to various people in the Scala community* that are known
for their work on tooling and invite them to have an informal discussion about
the tooling that they've worked on. We'll talk about why they started X tool,
how they've seen it grow and change over time, and also what they learned from
the experience. I can see this being especially interesting for tools that have
had multiple generations of maintainers.

Due to the informal structure of this and also it being hosted on Twitch,
questions from those watching would be welcomed and hopefully that informal chat
atmosphere that we had between talks at conferences can be mimicked.

## The process

1. Reach out to a few different people about this idea. I'd like to get at least
   3 lined up (1 per month) planned in order to start this. I don't want to get
   one, and then struggle to not be able to continue this.
2. We'll announce it ahead of time, hopefully spark up some interest, and then
   stream it. I'll figure out a nice OBS layout to show both people on the
   screen and also have the ability to show something in the browser or even in
   the terminal if necessary.* We can also figure out a way to get a logo or
   something to be _real professional_.
3. Upload these to YouTube for those that miss the actual stream.


## TODO

- [ ] Is there community interest in this sort of thing?
- [ ] Reach out to a few people to see if we can get a few people lined up.


* I mention Scala community here only because it's what I'm most familiar with.
    In the future there is no reason this can't expand to other language
    communities or even tooling that spreads across multiple languages.
* One of the things that really sparked me wanting to push this forward was a
    recent stream done by [TJ DeVries](https://www.twitch.tv/teej_dv) with
    special guest [Thorsten Ball](https://twitter.com/thorstenball). While that
    stream went _way_ more into the actual terminal doing demo's than I plan to
    do, it really showed that this type of thing has a ton of potential to be
    super interesting and engaging. You can check out the full [VOD
