## Thoughts on how the stream went

I really need to spend some time better understanding the encoding settings in
OBS. After the hiccup during Tooling Talks everything is sort of screwed up. I
tried actually streaming and saving locally at the same time and that totally
didn't work. It was eating up a crazy amount of CPU. @agilesteel pointed me to
this page https://stream.twitch.tv/encoding/ which I'll spend some more time
digging through.
