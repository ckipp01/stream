## The plan for the day
  - We can take a look at new stuff in Metals
      - Viewing TASTy files _added in metals and nvim-metals_
      - javap viewer _added in metals, but pr in nvim-metals_
      - semanticdb viewer _added in metals, but pr in nvim-metals_
      - type of code selection _added in metals, but not in nvim-metals_
      - code evaluation via DAP _pr in metals, nothing in nvim-metals needed_
      - find in jar extension _pr in metals, nothing in nvim-metals_
  - Changes
      - super method lenses now on by default
  - LSP changes in Neovim
      - new diagnostics _naming_
      - new format for handlers
      - a ton of new plugins and old plugins
  - Migrate nvim-metals to use plenary
  - what's the latest with tree-sitter-scala
  - TODO is the compact vs non compact semanticdb viewer working???

## Notes and links from the stream
  - since lspsaga is no longer maintained, is there another alternative for
      fancy UI stuff for like code actions, renames, etc
  - when we get the javap output, we should set the syntax to be java, not scala
  - I think one improvement that we can make on the metals side is that when
      someone sends in a `executeCommand` with a correct command, but incorrect
      arguments, we still respond with a command not found, when in reality it
      should incorrect params for the command
  - Everyone should check out https://github.com/dandavison/delta for better git
      diffs (shout to sourcegraph and suz hinton for turning me on to this)

  - The quote of the stream
    > tiruviendal: lol. Java is a syntactic sugar over JVM bytecode

  - another improvement we can make on the metals side is that if everything
      isnt' compile yet, the error message should be different for decode-file
      than it is if the uri is incorrect

## What we actually worked on
  - Did a lot of showing stuff, but ultimately worked on https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/pull/226

## Thoughts on how the stream went
Really great time being back. Good to see old names in chat, catch up a bit, and
just work on some stuff together. I missed this and hope to get back to somewhat
of a regular schedule.
