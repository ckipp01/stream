## Notes from the stream

## Thoughts on how the stream went

Overall pretty well. Considering literally almost a year ago I gave this a shot
and it was a total failure, I'm glad how today went. Had some issues with CPU.
For some reason OBS.live was going insane. Looking at my settings afterwards I
was outputting 1080 at 60fps, and I was dropping some frames in the video. I'll
bump this down to 720 at 60fps for next stream and also just use OBS vanilla to
see if that helps at all. Overall, I had fun.
