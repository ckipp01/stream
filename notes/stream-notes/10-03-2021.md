# 10-03-2021

## The plan for the day
  - Make sure all my new config stuff is working
  - Make sure all new `nvim-metals` + Plenary is working ok
  - type of selection range

## Notes and links from the stream
  - Why isn't the code lenses in the stack trace analyzer working anymore?
      - the unapply for this isn't working as expected, needs some fixes
  - Why when first open a document and grab the < marks they are 0?
      - This is sort of on hold until https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/3178 gets merged in


## What we actually worked on
  - https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/3178
  - https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/pull/232

## Thoughts on how the stream went
