## The plan for the day
  - Do a little overview of some new stuff
      - code lenses
      - selection ranges
  - BSP
  - DAP (Debug adapter protocol)
  - Look at LSP call hierarchy
  - Get input about new Metals website

## What we actually worked on
  - Did an overview of the new things, code lenses and selection ranges
  - Dove into adding super-method-hierarchy to nvim-metals

## Notes and links from the stream
  - call hierarchy from rust analyzer
      https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/2698
  - take a closer look at https://github.com/camspiers/snap, but I still love
      you TJ

## Thoughts on how the stream went

Good stream, set out to do one thing, realized I didn't yet support
super-method-hierarchy, and then dove into that. I thought I hit on an issue
with Metals but didn't realize the super-method-hierarchy doesn't take in text
document params, but instead it's own params.
