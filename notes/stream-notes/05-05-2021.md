## The plan for the day
  - nvim-metals close quickfix when there is no more diagnostics
    - https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/issues/133
  - https://github.com/scoverage/scalac-scoverage-plugin
    - the correct way to include scala-compiler
    - sbt-coveralls

## What we actually worked on

  - Sent in this pr to close the qf list when no diagnostics are left in
      nvim-metals: https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/pull/136
  - Sent in this pr for scalac-scoverage-plugin to correct the build
      dependencies:
      https://github.com/scoverage/scalac-scoverage-plugin/pull/325
  - Sent in a pr to scala-utils.nvim to ensure ending a query with `:` works as
      expected https://github.com/ckipp01/scala-utils.nvim

## Notes and links from the stream

A little bit to my surprise it looks like there are only two of these on the list
that are actually using the Provided scope

TODO: We should really figure out in what scenario when making a compiler plugin
can you not just have the scala-compiler as a provided dependency.

NOTE: I threw that question up on Twitter and it looks like there really isn't a
reason to not have it as `Provided`.

  - cloc
    - uses Provided
  - better-to-string
    - normal library dependency
  - wart-remover
    - the core it includes it as a normal dependency
    - macro-tests artifact is provided
  - kind-projects
    - just has it as a normal dependency 
  - silencer
    - also just has it as a normal dependency
  - scapegoat
    - this is provided
  - better-monadic-for
    - Included as a library dependency normally

## Thoughts on how the stream went

Fun stream tonight. We got a fair amount of stuff done and also talked about a
bunch of different stuff. This article came up again for like the 5th time this
last week for me:
