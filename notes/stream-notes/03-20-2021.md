## Plan for today

### Scala Tree-sitter related stuff
  - nvim-treesitter
    - get basic highlight queries for Scala done
  - Grammar itself
    - for loops and comprehensions
  - nvim-treesitter playground doesn't refresh correctly when using Scala
  - Figure out what is causing telescope to puke in Tree-sitter Scala

### What we actually worked on
  - Walking through how tree-sitter-scala works
  - Started to work on the highlights.scm queries for Scala

## Thoughts on how the stream went

This one was super fun, more engagement and the time really flew by. I finally
figured out my audio issue, so that helped a ton. Also using vanilla OBS has
really improved the memory usage from when I was using Streamlabs OBS. However I
have noticed that in darker conditions my camera is quite poor, so I need to
probably spend a little time figuring out my lighting situation.
