## The plan for the day
    - [ ] Start rewriting buildpress


## Notes and links from the stream

### Buildpress goals with the rewrite
    - simplify it with the Scala Toolkit
    - give some new features
        - maven support, gradle support, mill support
    - add better defaults
    - write it Scala 3
    - use scala-cli (native image)
    - scalacenter (coursier) apps
        - cs install buildpress

### Questions when playing
    - Do we actually need regenerate and clear-cache _or_ can we just combine
      these
    - Do we want to require a sha or do want to just dynamically pull in the
      latest if there is no sha

- Look into when you create a new file with scala-cli why does Metals not
  recognize it right away.
  - Metals issue?
  - scala-cli issue?


For example I wouldn't expected to see individual files here, but rather the
entire directory so it could be watched.

```

  /Users/ckipp/Documents/scala-workspace/scalacenter/buildpress/src/Buildpress.scala
  /Users/ckipp/Documents/scala-workspace/scalacenter/buildpress/src/BuildpressConfig.scala
  /Users/ckipp/Documents/scala-workspace/scalacenter/buildpress/src/Main.scala
  /Users/ckipp/Documents/scala-workspace/scalacenter/buildpress/src/RepositoryCache.scala
```

Is VS Code handling this differently, and are they sending some sort of
notification for a new file? Or does this work the same?
