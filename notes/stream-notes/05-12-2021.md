## The plan for the day
  - Look into adding TVP to nvim-metals
  - Look deep into what's going on with scaladoc-completions
  - Look into adding `cs resolve` into scala-utils.nvim

## What we actually worked on
  - We dove into TVP. Looked at what is is, looked at all the handlers that it
      needs, and then started implementing.

## Thoughts on how the stream went

Pretty quiet night tonight. Got a good framework laid out, but need to dive
into the correct tree structure to store and retrieve the nodes in a speedy way.
