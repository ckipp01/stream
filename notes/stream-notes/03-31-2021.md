## Thoughts on how the stream went

Stream was a lot of fun tonight. I even learned some new Vim tricks! I need to
get better and using the plugins to the fullest. vim-sandwich and vim-fugitive
are two that I don't take full advantage of. I had some internet issues tonight
which caused the stream to be split twice which sort of sucked. I also had some
lighting issues, which caused me not to be focused. I really need to figure out
a better lighting situation especially since I primarily stream at night.
