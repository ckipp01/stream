# 11-28-2021

## The plan for the day
  - demo of mill-bsp and metals
  - work on a few bsp related things in metals/mill
  - nvim-dap and nvim-metals

## Notes and links from the stream

### Issues we find with mill-bsp and metals
  - [ ] `LSP[metals][Log] ZinkWorker: using cache size 1`
      ```json
        [Trace - 02:21:27 PM] Received notification 'build/showMessage'
        Params: {
          "type": 4,
          "message": "ZinkWorker: using cache size 1"
        }
      ```
  - [ ] when you trigger a `workspace/reload` with an invalid build, it succeeds when
      it should fail (it seems that this does nothing and still sends a {} is
      that ok? should it be null, should it warn that it's not supported, etc)
  - [ ] related to the above, you can connect with an invalid build and it
      results in a loop of trying to reconnect, but never shows any info to the
      actual user.
  - [ ] Scala 3 doesn't work with `ScalaMetalsSupport`
      - Probably just grabbing grabbing the Scala version and trying to download
          semanticdb
  - [ ] Is including the entire env necessary in BSP communication
      - `buildTarget/scalaMainClasses` contains all your env variables...
          probably not what you want (sbt shows [], bloop shows [])
  - [ ] is it really a test provider???
  - [ ] is it really a run provider???
  - [ ] there is some stuff in `mill.bsp.stderr` that seems to not need to be in
      there
  - [ ] how much work would it be for mill to support the debug adapter

### Other things that aren't working or are funky
  - sbt server isn't showing the meta-build build targets
  - so can metals still request a run when the build server supports run but not
      debug, because you get the error below -- same with test (this is the
      case, but should it be -- should metals add a check for this)
   ```
    java.util.concurrent.CompletionException:
    scala.meta.internal.metals.MetalsBspException: BSP connection failed in the
    attempt to get: DebugSessionAddress.  Unsupported request method:
    debugSession/start
  ```
## What we actually worked on
  - Made all the notes up above

## Thoughts on how the stream went

Really fun playing around with Mill. Got a ton of stuff to look more into now.
