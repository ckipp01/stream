## The plan for the day
  - correct some of the testing in scalac-scoverage
    - split stuff out into unit/compiler
  - add and figure out more tests in dotty
    - poor test coverage
    - infrastructure is still confusing to me
    - test the invoker
  - clean up some of the build file stuff to account for scala 3

## Notes and links from the stream

  - We really need to fix <leader>a opening up the location list when the
      quickfix list is already open. What should we do in this situation?
  - Why does test file not find anything in serializer-test
  - /Users/ckipp/Documents/scala-workspace/dotty/compiler -- ok, so why does the
      main run from dotty/compiler and the test form dotty

## What we actually worked on
  - So the idea to split stuff out into unit, didn't work, instead we created
      another module called Serialization

## Thoughts on how the stream went

Another day where we were able to get a lot done. Still stuck on a few things
but really happy with the work. Got a huge raid from togglebit which was great!
