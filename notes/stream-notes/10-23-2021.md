## The plan for the day
  - scoverage... that's it
      - 1. Aggregate first -- what needs to come out of the plugin for this
      - 2. Reporter -- what needs to come out for this (this will be a package)
      - 3.? Domain -- another package with domain information
          - this might rely on nsc if so we can't pull that out
      - 4. Deserializer needs to be ripped out of the Serializer as well

## Notes and links from the stream
  - teej_dv: try Telescope find_files layout_strategy=vertical

## What we actually worked on
  - we were able to break out the reporter
    https://github.com/scoverage/scalac-scoverage-plugin/pull/405 (still needs a
    bit of work though)

## Thoughts on how the stream went

I'm amazed at how much work I actually got done today. Streamed out of a whim
since I was having trouble focusing and doing what I needed to do on scoverage,
so streaming was a shot in the dark at making me more productive and it worked,
ha.
