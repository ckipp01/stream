## The plan for the day
  - [x] Changes for the doctor inside of nvim-metals
  - [x] breaking changes in nvim-cmp so we need update my own dots and then also
     [x] update the docs/examples
  - new changes for 0.7.0 
      - [x] update ci to run on 0.7.0 and nightly
      - [x] new autocmd api
      - [ ] new add user commands api

  - make some final changes to metals docs about vim

## Notes and links from the stream
  - https://matrix.to/#/#scalameta/vim-users:matrix.org
      - This seems invalid so we need to figure out what the right link is
  - So when you do reset choice, why does it show you options to reset that you
      haven't chosen?
  - Figure out what's happening with my syntax in help files
