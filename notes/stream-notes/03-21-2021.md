## Plan for today

### Scala Tree-sitter related stuff
  - nvim-treesitter
    - get basic highlight queries for Scala done

## What we got done
  - Started hammering out the queries and say progress in syntax highlighting
  - Noticed a few things missing from tree-sitter-scala and added them in
    - Boolean literals
    - Character literals

## Thoughts on how the stream went

It went pretty well today. I cranked it up to 1080 output and I realized that if
we aren't doing Metals work this is ok. However, if I'm jumping into large
projects with Metals I notice a difference with screen quality. So I need to be
mindful of what I'll be working on, and adjust accordingly before stream.
