# 04-21-2021

## The plan for the day
  - Metals was just released, meaning we should update coc-metals
  - Check code action with scalacheck
  - nvim-metals functionality to not auto-start
  - scala-utils.nvim - maybe finish up the coursier stuff and maybe push up
  - BSP related issue, look on the backlog

## What we actually worked on
  - We finished the coc-metals release
  - We cleaned up a bit of the scala-utils project. It's ready for docs now and
      can probably be pushed up after that.

## Notes and links from the stream
  - Need to look into the create new symbol code action in nvim + metals to
      ensure that everything is working ok

## Thoughts on how the stream went
Stream went well tonight! It was a lot of fun. I felt a little bit all over the
place tonight and sort of felt like that might have been confusing for viewers,
so I think in the future I'll try to hone in on something a bit more specific
and stick to it.
