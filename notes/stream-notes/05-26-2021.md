## The plan for the day
  - TVP work in nvim-metals

## What we actually worked on
  - We did a full walk through of pretty much the entire implementation up to
      this point. We also then just worked on a few bugs.

## Thoughts on how the stream went

Overall ok. Pretty chill night. I didn't feel like we got a lot done, but it was
fun walking through the entire feature and answering some questions.
