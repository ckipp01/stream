## The plan for the day
  - Couple prs to review
  - We'll just dig into some old issues in Metals

## Notes and links from the stream
  - @evakuator mentioned this https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html

  - Notes on implementing https://github.com/scalameta/metals/issues/2697

      1. What format should users send this in? How? (User configuration?)
        key=value,value
        key:value,value

      2. We'd parse those values into map
      3. We'd check if a file already exists
        A. If it exists, then we parse the file and see if the key exist
          a. If it exists, do nothing because we don't want to override the key
          (maybe there is situations though were we'd want to append?)
          b. If it doesn't exist, just add it with the values
        B. If it doesn't exist, we'd create it and add the values
      4. Prompt for a restart of the server

  - Other concerns
    1. What if someone give the correct key but wrong value. Does the build
       server puke if that happens? Then how would this recover?

  - Other approaches
    1. Just edit the jvmOpts instead (this is easier)
      - What do we do in the case that there are conflicts

## What we actually worked on

We sort of just dug through the backlog a bunch and looked through a few issues.
