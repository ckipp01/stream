## The plan for the day
- Take a look at the new sbt support in sbt BSP / fix anything we find

## What we actually worked on
We pretty basically just dove into semanticdb in sbt for the entire time.

## Notes and links from the stream
  - How come when you add `semanticdbEnabled := true` to your build, it adds the
      semanticdb compiler plugin, but when you add it to your metabuild, it
      doesn't?

## Thoughts on how the stream went

Went pretty well. I didn't get a ton accomplished, but learned a fair amount on
the sbt side.
