## The plan for the day
  - Show and tell
  - Try to implement `textDocument/selectionRange` in Scala 3
  - Fix differing `MetalsInstallOrUpdate` command from the commands shown in
      telescope.

## What we actually worked on
  - Got a pr in Metals done about lazily getting explicit choices
      https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/2868
  - Got a nvim-pr done about MetalsUpdate
      https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/pull/155
  - We did some initial work on fixing the reveal in tree functionality in
      nvim-metals

## Notes and links from the stream
  - Add notifications for Ko-fi
  - Check out the Scala 3 implementation of better-2-string

## Thoughts on how the stream went
A little bit better quality today, but still not happy with it. Still need to
spend some more time on OBS and really figure out a way to bump the quality.
