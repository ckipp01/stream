## The plan for the day
  - nvim-metals - ability to toggle settings
  - metals prs - tons of stuff to review
  - coc-metals issues that I need to respond to

## Notes and links from the stream

  - What in the world is cscope (figure this out)
      http://cscope.sourceforge.net/
  - https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags
      I used to use this, but never really understood how it worked. Look into
      this so in the future if anyone asks, I can sound like I know what I'm
      talking about
  - Make sure to update the like for !music
  - Things to look into to better profile and debug the JVM
      - https://shipilev.net/
      - Brendan Greggs

## What we actually worked on
  - We just tried to figure out the toggle settings in nvim-metals, but found a
      bug in Metals, and worked on that.

## Thoughts on how the stream went

It was really nice to be back on stream again! Didn't quite get as much done as
I was hoping to, but it it was fun to chat about some stuff and dive into an
issue I've wanted to look at.
