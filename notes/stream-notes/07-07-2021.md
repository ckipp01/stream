## The plan for the day
  - maybe work on the presentation-compiler worksheet thing
      - clean up the Scala 2 one
      - work on the Scala 3 one
  - why redirects are not working on the Metals site when you are coming for the
      search
  - work on scala-utils and try to pipe the coursier output to telescope
  - work on documentation for nvim-metals on the Metals website now that NeoVim
      0.5.0 is out
  - try to add `textDocument/selectionRange` to NeoVim Core

## What we actually worked on
  - We cleaned up the scala2 presentation compiler example
  - We started the scala3 one

## Notes and links from the stream
  - I need to have some tests for nvim-metals (plenary)
  - Me and Jesse have no idea how this works, figure it out
      https://github.com/snyk/snyk-sbt-plugin
  - I don't understand this line in the Metals codebase
    ```scala
    protected def isEligible(t: Tree): Boolean = !t.pos.isTransparent
    ```
## Things I wish I told myself like 3 years ago to do

  - 1. Read more open source code that you're curious about
  - 2. Read more github issue discussions. There are some crazy smart people out
       there having really in depth discussions about in depth topics that is
       like free education (Olaf Geirsson, Eugune Yokota, Daniel Spiewak, etc
       are all good examples of this)

## Thoughts on how the stream went

Really fun to be back on the stream tonight. I was a bit tired, been a super
long week, but had a lot of fun.
