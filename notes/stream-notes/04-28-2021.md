## Thoughts on how the stream went

Fun stream tonight. I also got raided for the first time tonight by
https://www.twitch.tv/teej_dv with a 139 people, so that was a ton of fun.
Thanks for being my first raid TJ :) It was great since this week has been long
so far, and this put a huge smile on my face.
