## The plan for the day
  - Understand what the heck is going on with
    - https://github.com/scalameta/mdoc/issues/481
    - https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/2674

## What we actually worked on
  - We attempted to actually understand what was going on, but really didn't get
      there.

## Notes and links from the stream
  - Honestly, there is just a bunch of classloader stuff that I don't fully
      understand and need to dive into.

## Thoughts on how the stream went
  - Overall pretty well. I forgot to turn my mic on for the first 5 min, so that
      was awesome.. Also the chat didn't disappear like I expected it to, so I
      need to fix that in my overlay.
