## The plan for the day

Special Scala in NeoVim stream. We'll do a small presentation, dive into setting
up the plugins, and then just answer questions.

## What we actually worked on

  - We did the above as planned
  - Starting looking into an issue with nvim-metals

## Stream notes

  - Figure out a way to restart server with nvim-metals

## Thoughts on how the stream went
Super fun stream today. This was my longest stream to date. Also, last night I
was notified that I reached Affiliate, so that exciting! It was my goal to reach
this in the first month of streaming, and I'm happy to say that I got it with 3
days to spare.
