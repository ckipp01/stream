## The plan for the day
  - [x] Make sure commands aren't always being registered
  - [x] Look into (don't start by default) https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/issues/119
  - [x] Work a bit on ScalaUtilsNeoVimThing
  - Look into replacing my stuff with Plenary stuff

### Stretch goal
  - Maybe look into the graceful shutdown thing in NeoVim

## What we actually worked on
  - We got a couple prs made
    - https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/pull/126
    - https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/pull/127
  - We cleaned up the cs complete command in the utils a bit

## Notes and links from the stream

A couple Vim related things that I need to get more in the habit of doing...

1. At times it makes more sense to use `^` that `0`
2. Remember to use macros when it makes sense
  - `q{macro-name}` to start
  - do all the things
  - `q` to end
  - `@{macro-name}` to execute
  - `10@{macro-name}` to execute 10 times

## Thoughts on how the stream went

Fun stream. It was cool to get a couple things taken care of and also cool to
show some of the new stuff that I've been working with. There are still quite a
few things in Lua land that I need to get better at. Most notably, figure out
Lua metatables.
