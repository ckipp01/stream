## What some stuff we want to work on
  - Read through some of the semanticDB doc
  - metac, metap
  - How does Metals use semanticDB?
  - Be able to understand https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/2622/files

## What we actually worked on
  - Explored metac and metap
  - Looked a bit at semanticDB usage in Metals
  - Went over https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/2622/files
  - String trying to get nvim to generate semanticDB for a given file

## Notes from the stream

### What would a plugin need to do this
#### User needs these installed
  - metac
  - metap
#### What would the process be
  - get uri
  - metac <- produce semanticDB
  - plugin cache dir and we store it there
  - we'll read it back in with metap
  - open a split and put it there

## Thoughts on how the stream went

I think the last stream went a bit better. I feel like I had a task to do then
and I felt like I was able to stick to it and get something done. With talking
about semanticDB it was a bit more tricky to know exactly what to talk about or
to show.

### Lessons learned
  - Probably want to be more prepared or have a more specific task in mind

### Things I need to look into
  - Differences between `os.execute` and `fn.system`
  - A way to find a child file somehow with nvim
