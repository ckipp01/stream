## The plan for the day
  - [x] Look through the various BSP implementations for Scala
      - Bloop
      - sbt
      - Mill
      - Bazel
  - [ ] scala-welder.nvim
      - Right now you can completion a line of sbt deps
          - mill deps
          - generic one where you prompt the user for input

## What we actually worked on
  - We were able to demo how to switch between Bloop and sbt. We also then
      looked at the Mill BSP implementation and also tried to get the Bazel BSP
      implementation to work with Metals.

## Notes and links from the stream

  - When you're unable to organize imports at times the messages shown to the
      user are not really friendly. A prime example:
```

## Thoughts on how the stream went

Pretty quiet stream today, but still fun to look through some BSP stuff and find an
issue we should really fix in Metals.
