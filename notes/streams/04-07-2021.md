## Thoughts on how the stream went
Really fun stream today for me. I spent some time earlier in the week making a
cleaner layout where I have the top right be the chat overlay with a background
matching my terminal, and the bottom right being my image. I think it made for a
way smoother stream to look at. I also finally got my ring light in, and this
_really_ helped my camera in the low light. I was actually quite amazed at how
much of a difference this made.
