## The plan for the day
  - Continue the work on tree-sitter highlighting for Scala
  - Report missing parts of the Scala grammar

## What we actually worked on
  - Exactly as planned. We made progress on the highlighting and made a list of
      stuff to work on in tree-sitter-scala.

## Thoughts on how the stream went

It went pretty well tonight! I felt like we got some good progress done. I
realized there is still some lingo about Scala I need to get more familiar with
since as I am looking at code I don't always know the exact right term to call
something. That will make the progress with tree-sitter faster.
