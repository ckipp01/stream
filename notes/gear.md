# Gear I use to stream

To start out with I ended up going quite a bit more expensive on the audio than
the video. I figured I could get a lot of re-use out of the audio equipment for
other stuff in the case that I don't want to continue streaming. I figured once I
get used to streaming and it becomes more regular, I can improve my lighting and
video. Don't fall into the trap that you need a ton of fancy equipment to get
started streaming. The camera you may already have from work might work fine
with a cheap ring light.

  - [ELEGIANT Ring Light](https://www.amazon.nl/-/en/gp/product/B086QMRTXD)
      - This is basically one of the cheapest ones I could find. I wanted to see
          if this would really help before going crazy and buying an expensive
          Elgato light or something. This made a huge difference.
